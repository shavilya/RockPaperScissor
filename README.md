# RockPaperScissor
This repository contains the code for a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game implemented using Python's tkinter and random libraries. The game can be played by two players and the game rules are the same as the traditional game.

## Requirements
Python 3.x
Tkinter library

## Running the game
To run the game, simply clone the repository and navigate to the directory in your command line. Then run the following command: <br>
<code> python game.py </code>

This will open the game window where you can play the game.

## Game rules
The game is played by two players, player 1 and player 2.
Each round, both players select either rock, paper, or scissors.
The winner of the round is determined by the rules of Rock-Paper-Scissors.
The game ends when one player reaches a certain number of points (default is 3, but it can be changed in the code)
The player who reaches the set number of points first wins the game.

## Customization
You can customize the game by changing the code and adding new features, such as different game modes, different themes and images, or different rules.
